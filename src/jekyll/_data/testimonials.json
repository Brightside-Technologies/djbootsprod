At the time of the wedding everything was coming all together I was nervous and when I least expected the guy from the audio equipment I had rented was running late, the band that was going to play in my wedding was at the ballroom already to do sound check, it was that time that the band had to start playing already and Bryan from Dj Boots went above & beyond to provide audio equipment for the band to start playing. When Me & My Wife got to the ballroom we did the entrance everything looked perfect the music sound excellent. I thank Bryan for being professional at his work and being a friend.",
